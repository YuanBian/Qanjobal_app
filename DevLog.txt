Where should data be rendered?
Ideally, we only want to read data when it's necessary.
For example, when you're on the spanish topic, you should only read in data that's relevant to the spanish topic page (so no english topic should be read)

What should a LANG_MODE page receive?
A menu (A B C ), a content dictionary (x:y)

2. add "type": "module" in the package.json file
